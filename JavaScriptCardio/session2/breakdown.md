With each challenge, there are stars (\*\*\*) next to the section separators that indicate what the creator would do as the best option in an interview.

## Methods Glossary

- **match()** - Retrieves the result of matching a string against a regular expression
- **sort()** - Sorts the elements of an array and returns the reference to the same array with the default order of ascending, with converting the elements into strings and then comparing their sequences of UTF-16 code unit values
- **filter()** - A high order array function that takes in a function and will give a shallow copy of a portion of a given array that passes the criteria with the function you provide
- **slice()** - Returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array into a new array object selected from the start and end indexes that you provide. The original array will not be modified
- **apply()** - Instead of taking a list of args to pass to concat, it takes a single array and passes all elements and unravels a level of the array. Must have a function chained to it to use it
- **concat()** - Merges two or more arrays, and returns a new array rather than changing the existing arrays
- **fromCharCode()** - Returns a string created from the specified sequence of UTF-16 code units
- **charCodeAt()** - Returns an integer between 0 and 65535 representing the UTF-16 code unit at the given index
