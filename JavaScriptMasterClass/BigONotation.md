# Big O Notation

## What is Big O Notation?

- It's a way to compare and discuss the efficiency of an algorithm problem. There are multiple ways you can approach a problem, which are just as valid as the other, but to determine which one is best is by using a system that measures its performance in time and memory makeup and classifies it accordingly.
  - It's important to have a precise vocabulary to talk about how our code performs
  - When your code slows down or crashes, identifying parts of the code that are inefficient can help us find pain points in our applications
