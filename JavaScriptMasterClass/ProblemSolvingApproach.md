# Algorithms and Problem Solving Approach

- You're faced with a tough challenge, some code or a problem you have to solve, and you don't know how to do it right off the bat. What are the steps you can take to make it solvable?

> An **algorithm** is a process or set of steps to accomplish a certain task.

- Almost everything that you do in programming involves some kind of algorithm. It's the foundation for being a successful problem solver and developer
- This information is especially important for interviews, where you are given tough questions that you will be required to solve

### So how do you improve?

1. Devise a plan for solving problems
2. Master common problem solving patterns

### Problem-Solving Steps:

1. Understand the problem
2. Explore concrete examples
3. Break it down
4. Solve/Simplify
5. Look back and refactor

## Understand The Problem
