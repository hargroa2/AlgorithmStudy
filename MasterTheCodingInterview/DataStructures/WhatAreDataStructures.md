# What are Data Structures?

Data structures are simply ways to organize our data on our computers, and there are many variants that each have their own tradeoffs.

There are a few different operations that a data structure can perform:

1. Insertion - Add a new data item in a given collection of items
2. Deletion - Deleting a data item from a collection of items
3. Traversal - Access each data item exactly once so that it can be processed
4. Searching - Find the location of a data item if it exists in a given collection
5. Sorting - Having data be organized in a preferred order
6. Access - Accessing the data that we have on our computer

The different kinds of data structures are the following:

- Arrays
- Stacks
- Queues
- Linked lists
- Trees
- Tries
- Graphs
- Hash tables
